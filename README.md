An AR drawing application built with **SwiftUI**, **RealityKit** and **ARKit**. This app allows users to draw in 3D space using different brush materials, capture screenshots with animated previews, and receive real-time tracking feedback to enhance the AR experience. I plan to deploy it in App Store sometime in the future.

## Features

- **Brush Materials**: Choose between **Basic**, **Realistic**, and **Metallic** brush materials
- **Brush Width**: Choose between **narrow**, **medium**, and **wide** brush width 
- **Color Picker**: Select any color for your brush strokes.
- **Undo Functionality**: Easily remove the last brush stroke.
- **Screenshot Capture**: Take screenshots of your AR scene with a preview animation appearing at the bottom right corner.
